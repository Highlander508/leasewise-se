    "title": "Companies lose millions on untapped opportunities",
    "description": "Many companies lack an active strategy for their lease agreements – and are often not even aware that there is significant value to be gained through renegotiations. The result is that critical termination deadlines are missed, lease terms are never questioned, and premises costs rise unnecessarily.\n\nLease law, negotiation techniques, industry knowledge, and market insight are specialist competencies that few companies have internally. Simply 'keeping track' is not enough – each negotiation requires deep understanding of current market rents, legal pitfalls, and which terms are negotiable. Building internal expertise is both expensive and time-consuming.\n\nWith LeaseWise, you gain access to experienced specialists with years of industry experience who do this complex work for you. We monitor every agreement, know the market, negotiate professionally, and ensure you always have the right terms – a cost-effective solution where we only earn when you save."
